# Overview

After initializing CRA, I saw that it was using React 18, so I decided to use this as a chance to play around with Suspense and resources.

## Highlights

- Responsive design
- Grid items maintain aspect ratio
- Getting data from api
- Using pagination
- Animations
- Using third-party libraries (Material-UI, fast-average-color, axios)

## Installation

Because this uses React 18, currently you must install with the command
`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

## Resources

The loading pokeball animation was extracted from https://codepen.io/raubaca/pen/obaZmG
and lightly modified
